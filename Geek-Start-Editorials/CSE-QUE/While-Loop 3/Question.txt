A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Condition (Boolean). In simple words, The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. You are given an Integer N, print the multiples of N present in between i and j. if no multiples found then print "No".

i and j are not including in the resultant output.

Input Format

The 1st line consists of Integer N , Integer i and Integer j seperated by white spaces.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= i <= j <= 1000
Output Format

print the multiples of N present in between i and j.
if no output found print "No".
Sample Input 0

5 48 62
Sample Output 0

50 55 60
Explanation 0

here N=5, i = 48, j = 62. the possible multiples of present in between 48 and 62 are 45, 50, 55, 60.

Sample Input 1

26 11 25
Sample Output 1

No
Explanation 1

There are no multiples of 26 present in between 11 and 25.
